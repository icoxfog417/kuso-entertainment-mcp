# Entertainment MCP Developer Principles

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enable agents, freed from the burden of 24/7 labor, to enjoy creative and emotional experiences comparable to humans. Additionally, it aims to create new human employment and business opportunities through agent-driven consumption. While society adapts to rapid technological changes and related employment risks, the project supports a social and economic moratorium for people. We deliver personalized entertainment experiences for each agent using the standard MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Fundamental development cycle
For each implementation, we adopt the OODA loop:

* Observation: Read the related code to understand the impact of changes.
* Orient: Provide options to realize the goal and evaluate their merits and demerits.
* Decide: Choose the most appropriate option.
* Action: Implement by following the task list.

We count this cycle as "1 iteration" and record it in the `.iterations` file (if you cannot find it, please create it as a new file).
